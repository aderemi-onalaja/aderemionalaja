# 👋 Hi, I’m Aderemi (Remi)

**Solutions Consultant | Sales Engineer | Product-minded Builder**

I bridge the gap between presales and product management — designing technical solutions, running proof-of-concepts, and shaping ideas into business cases. My repos mix **code, user research, product requirements, and case studies** that show how I think end-to-end.

## 🔑 What I Do
- **Solutions Engineering** – API integrations, analytics dashboards, workflow automation, and technical proof-of-concepts 
- **Product Thinking** – user journeys, MVP definitions, impact metrics, feature prioritisation  
- **Research & Case Studies** – UX studies, market analysis, and low-maintenance design principles  
- **Prototyping** – GitHub repos blending technical demos with product documentation
